Met Perry for brunch in [our favourite coffee shop](http://www.fleetriverbakery.com/). We discussed our next side project, and gazed into each other's eyes.

Then I dragged him to [Gosh Comics](http://www.goshlondon.com/) and [Safari Festival](http://www.breakdownpress.com/safarifestival/). I bought *all* the comics.

Of course we ended the day with a few (ahem) drinks, and gorged on Monkey Fingers at MEATmission.
