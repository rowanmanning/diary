[Codebar](http://codebar.io/) meeting. Chatted future courses and tutorials.

Went to [<abbr title="East London Comics and Art Festival">ELCAF</abbr>](http://www.elcaf.co.uk/) with [Scarlett](http://brightondoodlediary.tumblr.com/) and [Kristina](http://www.kristinabullen.com/). It was fun! So many comics, so many people!
