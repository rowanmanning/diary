Got excited about next year's holiday plans with Andrew.

        So what do we need to work out ASAP?
    </p>

    <p class="line">
        <b class="speaker">Andrew:</b>
        Erm, budget? We should probably book flights soon.
    </p>

    <p class="line">
        <b class="speaker">Rowan:</b>
        Yep, it'd be amazing to go for a whole month.
    </p>

    <p class="line">
        <b class="speaker">Andrew:</b>
        Yes! Let's try for that.
    </p>

    <p class="line">
        <b class="speaker">Rowan:</b>
        Portland, maybe Seattle.
    </p>

    <p class="line">
        <b class="speaker">Andrew:</b>
        San Francisco is a must.
    </p>

    <p class="line">
        <b class="speaker">Rowan:</b>
        Yeah then maybe LA or Vegas?
    </p>

    <p class="line">
        <b class="speaker">Andrew:</b>
        And we're both thinking we should drive?
    </p>

    <p class="line">
        <b class="speaker">Rowan:</b>
        Hell yes!
    </p>

    <p class="line">
        <b class="speaker">Andrew:</b>
        Should we get a ridiculously big and fast American car?
    </p>

    <p class="line">
        <b class="speaker">Rowan:</b>
        You read my mind.
    </p>
