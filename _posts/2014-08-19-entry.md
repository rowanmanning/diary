This is the last entry in my second diary sketchbook. The third one is ready to go, though I weighed it up:

You get better (more confident) at drawing&hellip;  
&hellip;but your life is somewhat taken over by drawing.

It encourages you to be more social&hellip;  
&hellip;but you scramble for ideas on slow days.

It helps you organise your thoughts&hellip;  
&hellip;but you get embarrassed by yesterday's thoughts.
