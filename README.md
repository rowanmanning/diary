Rowan's Diary
=============

**Hi :wave: my doodle diary is no longer updated. It represents a portion of my life from 10th May 2014 to 23rd January 2015, so there's almost certainly some stuff in here I'm embarassed about. It might still be nice to read for some people ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**

This is the source code for [my daily doodle diary][site]. Every day I draw what's happened and how I'm feeling. This is public to both encourage me, and let far-away friends know what's happening.
